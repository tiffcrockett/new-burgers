# Eat-Da-Burger

## Description
Eat-Da-Burger is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and an ORM. It follows the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML. 

Eat-Da-Burger lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
